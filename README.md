# 🎠 Lazy Susan Coin Game

A strategic puzzle game where you must get all coins to show the same face (all heads or all tails) by examining cups and flipping coins strategically.

## 🎯 Game Rules

### Setup

5. **Spin Lazy Susan**: When ready, spin to check if you've won and reset the game

### Key Mechanics

- **Spinning Phase**: Spin the Lazy Susan to check win condition and reset
- **Turn Counting**: Turns only increment when spinning the Lazy Susan
